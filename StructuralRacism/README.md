# Projects modeling structural racism

## Schilling-style

* Rauch
  [Seeing Around Corners](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2002/04/seeing-around-corners/302471/)
  is a classic.
* Hart and Case [The Parable of the Polygons](http://ncase.me/polygons/) is nice for interactive
  work online.

My own thoughts: the fact that it was apparently **THIRTY YEARS**
before someone realized Schilling's segregation model was an Ising
model (and thus that there were some "obvious" problems at T=0) is a
clear call for the liberal arts. We need more Sociology and Psychology
students in our Physics classrooms, and more Physics students in our
Sociology and Psychology classrooms.

* Growth of Black Lives Matter. There's an
  [NPR story](http://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2016/03/02/468704888/combing-through-41-million-tweets-to-show-how-blacklivesmatter-exploded)
  which points to a [study](http://www.cmsimpact.org/blmreport) and a
  [PDF](http://www.cmsimpact.org/sites/default/files/beyond_the_hashtags_2016.pdf)
  with data (thanks, Maria)
* [Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining). A map can be
  found
  [here](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/03/mapping-the-lasting-effects-of-redlining/388333/)
  that has good depictions (thanks, Julia).
* from @diffusiveblob, ```First thought: police encounters. Assuming
  equal criminality rates, how much does bias in stop rate change
  conviction %? What about positive feedbacks? If stop rate biased,
  and prior arrests/etc taken into account for lenience, effect
  amplified. Other aspects could be spatial: suppose more patrols in
  perceived high crime areas, but percepts depend on biased arrest
  nos. How much does population movement / broadness of police
  response affect how neighborhood police presence/crime rates vary?```
